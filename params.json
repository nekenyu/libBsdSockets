{"name":"Libbsdsockets","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to libBsdSockets\r\n\r\nThis project is a set of convenience wrappers around the BSD socket library.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to provide a far easier means of usage than the low level socket calls while providing the ability to do more detailed actions.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- Creating an Internet Address with a call using the host name and service name.\r\n- Creating a ServerSocket from and Address ready to select and accept incoming connections in one line; however, the bind and listen calls can also be deferred by calling bind and listen as desired after create.\r\n- Creating a ClientSocket ready to select data in one line; however, the connection call can also be deferred by calling connect as desired after create.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe author is Jonathan Seng (@nekenyu).\r\n\r\nThere are currently no other contributors.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
