\section intro_sec Introduction

This project is a set of convenience wrappers around the BSD socket library.

The aim is to provide a far easier means of usage than the low level socket calls while providing the ability to do more detailed actions.

Examples:
- Creating an Internet Address with a call using the host name and service name.
- Creating a ServerSocket from and Address ready to select and accept incoming connections in one line; however, the bind and listen calls can also be deferred by calling bind and listen as desired after create.
- Creating a ClientSocket ready to select data in one line; however, the connection call can also be deferred by calling connect as desired after create.
