/**
\page todo Todo List for libBsdSockets

- Testing
  + IPv6 Sockets
  + Local Domain Sockets
  + UDP Packets
    + Not using accept
  + IP Packets
  + Deferred connect and bind & listen
- Does it every make sense to allow an empty service name for an InetAddress?
- Socket requires understanding socklen_t.  Not much we can do but convert to size_t?
- Add SocketSet
- Add sendto / receivefrom
- Add sendmsg / receivemsg
- Unspecified Address type
  + Add it
  + Replace hack in accept with returning the unspecified address type, which means a real factory
